# Movies-Normalization
This assignment will cover normalization ideas by normalizing a database into the 3rd Normal form. By normalizing your tables, you may increase storage effectiveness, data integrity, and flexibility by eliminating duplicate data. We will be using Entity Relationship Diagrams or ERDâ€™s to show the relationship between entities in the normalized database. We will also be using joins to combine data from multiple tables.
The first part of the assignment will be choosing the dataset, creating a schema, creating a table structure, and storing the data from flat file into the created table using MySQL Workbench. The table will then be checked for 1NF, 2NF and 3NF. An ERD will be created in MySQL Workbench. Using advanced SQL and join queries the normalized tables will be linked.
